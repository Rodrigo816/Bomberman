# Bomberman

This little Game was created on the extra hours of programming boocamp lectured by acadeiadecodigo.org,
after just one month learning Java.

The goal was to improve our team skills in a stressfull envoironment.
The main rule was:
We could only use SimpleGraphics library to create the animations.

As this was made in a very early stage of our learnig process, there are many bugs, and the code might look terrible in you eyes.

Thanks to our Master Coders.

The team:
César Cota
Rodrigo Borba
Soraia Veríssomo
