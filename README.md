This little Game was created in the extra hours of a programming boocamp lectured by acadeiadecodigo.org,
after less than one month learning Java.

The goal was to improve our team skills in a stressfull environment.
The main rule was:
We could only use the SimpleGraphics library to create the animations.

As this was created at a very early stage of our learnig process, there are many bugs, and the code might look terrible in you eyes.

Thanks to our Master Coders.
